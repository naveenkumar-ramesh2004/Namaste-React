# üìò Namaste React - Episode Inception Notes

## üß© What is React?
**React** is a JavaScript library used for building **dynamic, fast, and interactive user interfaces (UIs)**.  
It allows developers to create reusable components that update automatically when data changes.

‚û° Example: When you like a YouTube video, only that section updates ‚Äî not the whole page.

## üß† Explanations

### 1. What is React?
- React is a **JavaScript library** developed by **Facebook (Meta)**.
- It helps in creating **dynamic UIs** that update efficiently.
- It uses a **Virtual DOM** to make updates faster and smoother.
- React is **component-based**, meaning each part of the UI is a small, reusable piece of code.

---

### 2. Dynamic User Interfaces (UIs)
A **Dynamic UI** changes based on user actions or data updates without reloading the page.  
‚û° Example: When you comment or like a post, the change happens instantly.

---

### 3. Single Page Applications (SPAs)
A **Single Page Application** loads one main HTML file, and React updates parts of the page dynamically.  
‚û° Example: Gmail or Netflix ‚Äî only content updates, not the entire page.

---

### 4. Component-Based Architecture
- Think of components like **LEGO blocks**.  
- Each block (component) does one job ‚Äî such as header, footer, or button.
- You can reuse them anywhere in your app.

---

### 5. Cross-Origin
When your webpage loads files (like images, CSS, or scripts) from **a different domain**, it‚Äôs called **cross-origin** access.  
React uses `crossorigin` in script tags to securely load scripts from a CDN.

---

### 6. Emmet
**Emmet** helps developers write HTML faster using short abbreviations.  
‚û° Example:
```html
div.container>h1{Hello}
```
becomes:
```html
<div class="container">
  <h1>Hello</h1>
</div>
```

---

### 7. Library vs Framework
| Feature | Library | Framework |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Control | You control the flow | Framework controls the flow |
| Example | React, Lodash | Angular, Django |
| Use | Pick and use what you need | Must follow its rules and structure |

---

### 8. CDN (Content Delivery Network)
A **CDN** delivers files (like React JS) faster from nearby servers.  
You can load React directly using CDN links instead of installing packages.

‚û° Example:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```

---

### 9. Why React is called React?
React is called ‚ÄúReact‚Äù because it **reacts** automatically to changes in data and updates the UI efficiently without full page reloads.

---

### 10. Crossorigin in Script Tag
The `crossorigin` attribute tells the browser that it‚Äôs okay to load files from other domains securely.

‚û° Example:
```html
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
```

---

### 11. React vs ReactDOM
| React | ReactDOM |
|--------|-----------|
| Handles component logic, state, and creation | Handles rendering to the browser DOM |
| Example: `React.createElement()` | Example: `ReactDOM.createRoot()` |

---

### 12. react.development.js vs react.production.js
| File | Use |
|------|------|
| **react.development.js** | Used for development, includes helpful warnings |
| **react.production.js** | Used in production, optimized and smaller for speed |

---

### 13. Async and Defer
| Attribute | Description | When Script Runs |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| **async** | Loads file asynchronously (parallel with HTML) | Runs as soon as downloaded |
| **defer** | Loads in background but executes **after HTML parsing** | Runs after HTML is fully loaded |

‚û° Example:
```html
<script async src="file.js"></script>
<script defer src="file.js"></script>
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
In **Day 1 of Namaste React**, you learned:
- What React is and why it‚Äôs powerful
- Core concepts like SPA, components, CDN, and script handling
- The difference between React, ReactDOM, and script attributes

Keep revising these topics with small examples.  
React becomes easier when you understand *how it thinks*! ‚ö°
